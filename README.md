## Data Pre-processing 
After I had sraped and downloaded all the data I needed, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for the model and analysis. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 


## Exploratory data analysis 
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.

## ML/DL Model Building 

First, I transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables. I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.   

I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers arenâ€™t particularly bad in for this type of model.   

I tried three different models:
*	**Multiple Linear Regression** â€“ Baseline for the model
*	**Lasso Regression** â€“ Because of the sparse data from the many categorical variables, I thought a normalized regression like lasso would be effective.
*	**Random Forest** â€“ Again, with the sparsity associated with the data, I thought that this would be a good fit. 

## Model performance
The Random Forest model far outperformed the other approaches on the test and validation sets. 
*	**Random Forest** : MAE = 11.22
*	**Linear Regression**: MAE = 18.86
*	**Ridge Regression**: MAE = 19.67

## Deployment 
In this step, I built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver by following along with the TDS tutorial in the reference section above. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values from a job listing and returns an estimated salary. 

## Evaluation 
In this step, I built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver by following along with the TDS tutorial in the reference section above. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values from a job listing and returns an estimated salary.
